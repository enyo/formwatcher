      <h1>Formwatcher</h1>

      <p>The formwatcher is a tool to easily improve forms with javascript based on the jquery library.</p>

      <p>It is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, so that every form remains intact if javascript is not enabled.</p>

      <p>Obviously this site is under construction. Hopefully the real site will be online 2011.</p>
